## COVID-19 Data Analysis Using SQL
In this project, I am analyzing a covid 19 data set. I split the data into two different files. One is 'COVID death', which has all the information regarding the cases and deaths for each country
; the other is 'COVID vaccination ', which includes information regarding the vaccination from February 2020 till October 2021. with more than 100,000 records. The purpose of this project is to analyze and extract important
pieces of information.

I obtained the data from 'ourworldindata.com' and will use my SQL to analyze it.
Some of the information to extract from the data is 
* the  chance of death if a person is infected based on each country 
* what are the countries with highest infection rate
